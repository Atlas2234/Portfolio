    <h4 class="about-title">skills and talents</h4>
    <p class="about-text">Most of my skills stemmed from my hobbies. My fascination with music inspired me to start playing musical instruments. To this day I have ten plus years of piano experience, and five plus years of acoustic and electric guitar experience. I can also play a small amount of violen but I was never good at it. My interest in video games ultimately motivated me to try and make them. As a result of my interest, I have some basic understanding and experience with the Unity game engine. Consequently, I started to take interest in other areas of technology as well and now have experience with multiple programming languages used for multiple purposes. The languages and frameworks that I know include C, C#, Java, MIPS Assembly, SQLite, Javascript, Python, Python Flask, HTML, and CSS. I have also had an interest in art and thus have taken art lessons. I can make pencil sketches, pen sketches, acrylic paintings, and oil paintings; I also experimented with photoshop art and done some artwork on that as well. I recently also took an interest in pixel art and have been doing some small drawings with Piskel. You can find some of my artwork on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy3AEFywtbznEZn9aQHBBGA" target="_blank">youtube</a> and the some more on my <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/atlas1234512345" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a> account.</p>
