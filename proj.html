     <h4>Unity Horror Game</h4>
     <p class="date">May 6, 2021</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
     <p>A short horror game that I made by myself with the Unity 3D Engine. The name of the game is called "The Halls". The scripts are written in C# and the map was made with probuilder, a Unity asset. All models, sounds, and textures used in the game are free assets taken from the Unity asset store and freesounds.org. The actual gameplay mechanics and scripts are made from scratch by me. You can watch a video of it <a href="">here</a> or download and play it <a href="">here</a>.</p>

     <h4>CSCb63 Website</h4>
     <p class="date">April 21, 2021</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
     <p>A redesign and remake of a course website from my university using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was an assignment my "Introduction to Databases and Web Development" course at University of Toronto, and it was coded by me and a partner. Everything in the assignment was done by us. We made the mockup using mockingbird and adobe XD, designed the frontend with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and programmed the backend with Flask. You can find the project on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Atlas2234/cscb63site" target="_blank">here</a>. The original github repository was made by my partner and was privated so I made a separate one.</p>

    <h4>First Site</h4>
    <p class="date">August 16, 2020</p>
   </div>
   <div class="info">
    <p>This is the very first website I have ever made from scratch. It was made using HTML, CSS, and a little of Javascript. I was following a tutorial for this site but tweaking all the things that they were teaching, as well as, changing up the template from the original one used in the tutorial. You can view the code <a href="https://github.com/Atlas2234/First-Project" target="_blank">here</a> and the website <a href="https://first-project-11.netlify.app" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
